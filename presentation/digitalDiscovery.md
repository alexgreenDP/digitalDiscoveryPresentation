My work investigates how blockchain technology is a means by which communities can collaborate.

Blockchain underpins Bitcoin; a digital currency where you transfer value by providing an electronic signature, a process similar to signing a cheque.

But blockchains also have applications aside from Bitcoin. That's because a blockchain is a very capable distributed database, a prized quality in our present Information Age, where data is King (unless, of course, you're Cambridge Analytica).

Blockchains are formed by blocks of information based on a chain of transactions - hence the name. The technology is independent of any controlling entity because nodes on its network are equally privileged. They also include numerous security measures; properties that result in a system ideally suited for trusted cooperation.

My work demonstrates that potential in three key areas. The first is financial technologies, where I wrote a paper discussing a distributed currency exchange, which the Indian Government, in its drive to digitise their economy, could have used to exchange Rupees into Bitcoin, thereby banking the unbanked.

The second area is provenance. My article on Fake News describes a photo that a prominent supporter of Donald Trump claimed showed the Clinton Campaign doctoring votes. The New York Times went to great lengths to prove the picture was fake; I create a scenario where the paper is saved a lot of bother because the photographer uses my blockchain app' to establish the origins of her snap.
